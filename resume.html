    <h2>Professional Experiences</h2>

    <h3>Summer Intern, Bosch India</h3>
    <h5>May 2019 - Jul 2019</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed a prototype of a motion sensing Light using Arduino.</li>
        <li>Designed and PLC programmed a Washer Dispensing Machine.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>CONSULTANT, WORLDQUANT</h3>
    <h5>Mar 2019 - Oct 2019</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>My work involved continuously produce high-quality trading signals (alphas) through the proprietary research platform to employ trading strategies
focused on market inefficiencies</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>Search Engine to query HTTP logs using Golang </h3>
      <h5>Jul 2020</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The project involved accepting logs files ( upload endpoint ) and then adding to the queue for processing Index logs (in batches) to ElasticSearch followed by processing the log queue and saving basic API level minute level statistics in the database (SQL). Caching Endpoint for getting an API level traffic graph and creating a backup for long term retention. The APIs were deployed on an AWS EC2 machine .</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Designing and Simulation of an Analog Multiplier using FinFET's </h3>
      <h5>Jan 2020 - Jul 2020</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>In this project, we describe a new FinFET four-quadrant analog multiplier that employs a similar concept of low sensitivity to component mismatch but circuit realization of the preprocessing block is more simple and compact. The multiplier circuit is formed by connecting four new 2-input preprocessing circuit blocks, which here are called “subtractor” cells, with two combiner cells. The subtractor is formed by a stacking connection of only 2 transistors without any passive element. This novel combination results in a multiplier circuit with lower component count (thus less complexity) and higher linearity than a circuit that uses combiner cells only when compared at the same quiescent power consumption.
The circuit designed is particularly suitable for applications requiring a very low-voltage operation. The circuit comprises a small number of combiner cells thereby reducing the number of resistors used, leading to lower component count and very low quiescent current consumption. Because of the circuit topology, harmonic distortion is low and operating frequency is high. Simulated results have been provided to show the performance of the circuit.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Atmospheric correction of satellite data with haze removal </h3>
      <h5>Oct 2019 – Nov 2019</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The quality of a captured image in bad weather is usually degraded by the presence of haze or fog in the atmosphere since the incident light to a camera is attenuated and the image contrast is reduced. This has become a major problem in many computer vision applications. In this project, we have performed single image dehazing Given the hazy image, we compute the dark channel. Based on the assumption that the dark channel of the haze-free image is zero, we obtain the raw transmission map. Estimate the atmosphere light A. Then we perform transmission refinement by solving a sparse linear system or using a guided filter. Finally, we use refined transmission and estimated atmospheric light to calculate the scene radiance, which is results haze-free image.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>PLC PROGRAMMING OF WASHER DISPENSER </h3>
        <h5>Jun 2019 - Jul 2019</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>During this project I learnt the concepts of PLC programming which is very widely used today in every industry. It involves the concepts of both
mechanical and electronics. My work involved the PLC connection and PLC coding of its logic. I also learnt troubleshooting a working model and
dealt with the various mechanical and electrical problems.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Motion Sensing Light using Arduino </h3>
          <h5>May 2019 - Jun 2019</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>During this project I did the software interfacing with the help of Arduino UNO . I learnt about drivers, Arduino and different ways in which this
project can be done with or without using arduino and with just PIC Microcontrollers.</li>
            </ul>
