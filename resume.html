                <tr>
                  <td>Using Databases with Python </td><td>Coursera</td><td>In this course, I learned the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design
for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort. Used SQLite3 as its
database. We also build web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and visualization processes. We used the
D3.js library to do basic data visualization.</td>

<tr>
  <td>Using Python to Access Web Data </td><td>Coursera</td><td>During this course, I learned how one can treat the Internet as a source of data. Scrape, Parsing, and reading
web data as well as access data using web APIs. I worked with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Python Data Structures </td><td>Coursera</td><td>This course helped me understand and apply the core data structures of the Python programming language. I
moved past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data
structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis.</td>

<tr>
  <td>Training on "KARAKURI KAIZEN" </td><td>JaP/TEF</td><td>Karakuri Kaizen is a mechanical device that generally improves work.The device uses only mechanical
gadgetry, and shuns electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic power. It is also not controlled by a computer but rather by
the design of the mechanics. In this training I successfully developed a working model of a certified Karakuri
project.</td>
